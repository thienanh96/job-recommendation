<h2>What ‘Job Matching’ Really Means </h2>
<p>
If you have ever posted a job opportunity on a job board, or applied for a job through one, you may have encountered the term “job matching.” The same is true if you are looking for job board software as part of your website monetization platform. Job matching is a particular way of determining how a job listing and a job applicant are properly matched together.

<h3>Keywords Can Only Do So Much </h3>
<p>Many job boards today promise “job matching,” but what they’re really talking about is keyword matching, which can be helpful, but which isn’t as accurate as true job matching technology. Keyword matching is prone to inaccuracies because it doesn’t take into account things like your skill set and qualifications. You could search on keywords and get a lot of irrelevant results, while at the same time missing out on results that would actually be well-suited to your particular skills mix and qualifications.

Suppose you’re a medical assistant working in a pediatrics office, and you’re looking for a new opportunity. With the typical job board software, “job matching” might mean that you type the words “medical” and “assistant” into a job search engine. There’s nothing wrong with this, except that it will present results for “assistant” positions that may have nothing to do with medicine, as well as results for “medical” positions that may have nothing to do with being a medical assistant. In other words, you’ll waste time sifting through non-relevant job listings. Haven’t we come further than this by now?

<h3> The Term “Job Matching” Is Misused</h3>
<p>
	Many job board software products claim to have “job matching” included in their platforms, but they rely on keyword based searching to run the platforms rather than performance-based matching of positions to applicants. True job matching doesn’t rely on keyword searching, because it is about matching the most qualified candidates to the best jobs automatically and in real time. With true job matching, as a medical assistant, you would be automatically matched with medical assistant job listings for which you meet qualifications based on your resume, skill set, and preferences.

<h3>What True Job Matching Involves</h3>
<p>True job matching also automatically allows employers to receive qualified candidates right to their employer accounts, so that they can quickly review these candidates and make a hire sooner. RealMatch technology is the only true, real-time job matching technology on the market today. It matches job seekers to open postings on TheJobNetwork (an extensive network of job boards) based on resumes and user profiles, and has built-in mobile friendliness, so job candidates are never out of touch.

As a job seeker for a medical assistant position, you would be delivered job matches ranked by match percentage, helping you find the most relevant positions for which you’re qualified right away. Likewise, employers receive matches from active applicants and matching passive candidates directly into their employer account, graded and ranked based on match percentage. There’s simply no better or faster way for employers and job candidates to find each other</p>
<h3>When Evaluating Job Board Software for Your Site</h3>
<p>If you have a trade publication website or a local digital newspaper and are considering adding a job board as a way of making your site stickier and developing revenue, it’s important that you understand the job board software that different job board solutions use. Providers may use the term “job matching” loosely, matching candidates to opportunities based on keywords. This can ultimately be a turnoff for users of your job board, both on the job seeking and employer listing sides. The inherent level of inaccuracy in keyword searches will draw in extraneous results that aren’t relevant, while risking missing results that would actually be good matches.</p>
