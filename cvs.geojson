The approach we adopt is based on agent technology, particularly multi-agent systems. Each driver is represented by a software agent. A virtual environment is used to simulate drivers\\u2019 behaviour, thus enabling us to observe the conditions leading to road rage. The simulated model is then used to suggest possible ways of alleviating this societal problem. Our agents are equipped with an emotional module which will make their behaviours more human-like. For this, we propose a computational emotion model based on the OCC model and probabilistic cognitive maps. The key influencing factors that are included in the model are personality, emotions and some social\\/personal attributes.\"},{\"title\":\"Multitasking in emotion modelling: Attention Control\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\\/xpl\\/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7344588&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7344588\",\"displayDate\":\"2015-09\",\"description\":\"The work described in this paper is about building a general model capable of simulating human behaviour and emotions using virtual characters. To make the simulation realistic enough, virtual characters need to express emotions according to the environment and deal with those emotions in a parallel way where an emotional experience can be triggered at the same time as another emotional response. The virtual character will have perceptions, feel and express emotions and respond to different situations. To make the simulation realistic, we used a method allowing the virtual characters to execute tasks, perceive events and display emotions in a parallel way. To do that, we used the multiple resources model [1] to control the attention and to predict when two or more actions can be executed at the same time. The used emotional model is based on Scherer's theory [2]. However, in this paper we focus on the control of the attention as a part of the emotional process.\"}]",

I work very well as part of a team and get along with all age and diverse groups. I am also very self-motivated and can work on my own initiative. In the businesses that I have owned, I have frequently faced situations which I have had to apply myself and make decisions quickly but thoroughly and feel I can resolve matters quickly and effectively for myself. I and my husband have owned an extremely busy restaurant in Leeds City Centre in which I had responsibility of management of the business, recruitment of staff, customer service and quality control, stock control and banking. I have also owned a ladies fashion boutique in the picturesque town of Beverley which sold designer clothes. I designed the shop interior and it became a very successful business. I have had many different positions in the past and have gained valuable experiences in all and happy to say I am an all-rounder who is more than capable of any task given and work to my fullest potential.",

        "summary": "I am a Unity Expert, with strong unity usage since 2010, and have been programming since I was age 10.   For the last year and a couple of months I have worked as a VR Developer for Babcock Learning Solutions, using my in depth unity knowledge to create a wide range of VR, AR and and Motion Simulation applications to be used in a variety of applications including health & safety and training.  I am also a post graduate with a MSc in Video Game Enterprise and Production from Birmingham City Postgraduates for which I was awarded a Full Scholarship on behalf of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe after being interviewed by a panel of in-industry developers, and a BSc in Computer Science from The University of Hull. I have also worked as a Computer Science Lab Demonstrator due to my skills as a programmer whilst at The University of Hull, as well as having spent a year working for Microsoft as a Windows Game Ambassador and Microsoft Student Partner. I also possess a clean driving license and my own taxed and insured car, driving for over 8 years. I am used to long commutes, currently commuting 90 minutes to get to work, and having done many long commutes for my job at Microsoft.   Due to my skills and knowledge within game development I have worked as a Windows Game Ambassador for Microsoft after being talent scouted, as well as a Lab Demonstrator for Computer Science at the University of Hull. After interviewing for and receiving an Unconditional Offer for my MSc, I was shortlisted to interview for an academic scholarship provided on behalf of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. This interview consisted of a panel of in-industry professionals, and I was successful and was awarded a Full Scholarship. I was the only student on my course that opted to attempt a mock business start up for my thesis, for which I received a commendation. This business which is now ready to incorporate, is going to be run and managed by my friends, as I have opted to forfeit my shares and instead seek full time employment, where I believe my diverse skillset will serve me well.   The game “Nirvana” was exhibited at Insomnia Festival 59 in the Indie Zone at 9th-11th December. During the course I also worked on “Picatsso” for iOS as Art/Programming Producer and “Xtreme Drone Racing” for Playstation 4 as Technical Design Liaison on the Framework Team.  Currently I own shares in a game company called \"GameDev Couple LTD\" which is half owned by my girlfriend. We intend to use this company to release portfolio releases and fulfill our passion of developing indie games at the weekend, which in turn keeps me constantly evolving and learning new techniques and technologies.",

        "summary": "Overview A senior/lead full stack .Net developer (C#/MVC/SQL/HTML/CSS/JS) with over 17 years of commercial experience in backend and frontend disciplines. A proactive contributor throughout the software development lifecycle and an end-user champion. An accomplished collaborative partner adept at assessing requirements in the context of clients’ broader objectives, explaining technical concepts plainly and achieving consensus among stakeholders. A respected team player energised by new challenges together with personal and team development.  Through my own business, I’ve worked with clients including T-Mobile, 3Com and the Diocese of Brentwood. Whilst working with the latter around the time of the release of ASP.Net 2.0, I transitioned from PHP to the .Net Framework and using this I developed a bespoke CMS for the client. I employed a junior developer full-time during this period to look after my smaller clients.  In 2010 I moved to PlusOne, a general insurance administration company, to work on their .Net MVC-based agent quoting platform. From here I went to a recruitment software company, Konetic, to play a lead role in the design and development of their enterprise-class applicant tracking system which managed major global recruitment programs. In my current role at Vuture I have been implementing a new web application for Savills – a global property management company – with a particular focus on data layer optimisation. This project – due to complete in Spring 2018 – will transform over 60 international sites. My previous project was for a dual-language site implementation for Hong Kong based subsidiary Savills Guardian.  Outside of work I’ve volunteered as a senior youth leader with my local youth service. I’ve mentored young leaders and had responsibility for thousands of young people on events in the UK and abroad. I have also used my expertise to produce marketing material for them including the filming and production of DVDs used to showcase their events in schools across Essex and London.  I’m hoping to fulfil a long-held ambition to work in Asia and in 2017 I enrolled in evening classes to study Mandarin, sitting my HSK Level 1 exam in April 2018. After some further progression I intend to study Cantonese with a view to relocating to Hong Kong when an opportunity arises.  Professionally, I’m interested in all roles that offer clear career progression, especially those with an element of leadership or with a focus on FinTech or mobile app development. I offer full stack coding ability and years of multi-sector business and commercial experience.

        "summary": "'I learned the value of hard working by working hard' is a quote that pretty much sums me up. My name is Naim Salih and I am hard working. Getting an end result all comes down to how hard you work in order to be able to achieve goals. I have worked hard at every thing I set my mind to, from work to education I have strived to do the best I can to put me in the best position to get what I deserve. I am a young, conscientious , bubbly young man with a lot of passion to make changes in any given situation. I can work as part of a team as I love listening to new, fresh ideas but can also work alone. Through out my life there have been occasions where I have had to be alone such as being at University and have had to provide for myself and there have been occasions where I have to work as part of a team such as when I played for the National Youth Football Team. I have had to excel in either when I am alone or as part of a team. Time management is not a problem as I always make sure I leave enough time to get to work as getting to work early gets me mentally awake before a shift. I am confident and love talking to customers and would do try my best to satisfy their needs. I can also deal with rather unsavoury customers in a mature, professional manner without any drama. I believe I can offer any company a hard working, confident and trust worthy individual who will try his best in any task given. I do aim to become a manager of a business in the future hence why I am working so hard to attempt to achieve my goals.",

During my teaching of the international curriculums, I have witnessed their value in guiding young individuals towards promising futures built on self-awareness, kindness and an insatiable sense of curiousity which I also find highly complimentary to the UK curriculum.  I believe a learning environment should be a fun, safe space that encourages young minds to explore, question and grow. I have high expectations of both my students and myself and believe that we must be challenged in life in order to recognise our true potential.

Available from: Immediately. I am a degree qualified, hard-working individual with a passion for helping others and learning about new things. I am very outgoing and ambitious, I strive for success in everything that I do. I am known for constantly setting challenging goals for myself, whether it be a half marathon or a solo travel trip around S.E. Asia. After finishing my studies at The University of Aberdeen, I went on a gap year to Canada. After the year was over I came back to Scotland and worked in customer services as a Collections Agent for Wescot. This job role allowed me to help others and it was extremely fulfilling. After 10 months in the role I decided to embark on a new challenge and moved to China to teach young children English. However, the move presented many challenges and obstacles. I overcame these obstacles and have now decided it’s time to return to the U.K. to go back to what I’m good at, and what I know I get great satisfaction from. That for me is working in the customer services sector and helping people.",

This facilitates the detection of subtle differences between chemically similar inks. This study analysed a variety of blue, red and black gel inks on white office paper using HSI. The potential of the technique for ink discrimination compared to other analytical methods of examination is highlighted. Discriminating powers of 1.00, 0.90 and 0.40 were achieved using HSI for red, blue and black gel inks respectively. The overall discriminating power of 0.76 for the technique combined with its non-destructive nature and minimal sampling requirements demonstrates promise for this type of application.\"},{\"title\":\"A preliminary investigation of the hyperspectral imaging capabilities of the Foster and Freeman VSC 6000\\/HS for the analysis of gel inks\",\"url\":\"\",\"displayDate\":\"2012-08-20\",\"description\":\"An emerging technique in the analysis of inks and which can be applied in particular to gel pen inks is that of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI). Through the use of linear interference filter, it is possible to view the ink on a document over a series of \\ufb01nely tuned wavelengths across the visible-\\u00adNIR range to produce an image cube. These images can be played back in real time to determine how two or more inks behave across the wavelength range, making it easier to visualise di\\ufb00erences in their appearance under \\ufb01ltered light. In addition, the intensity of each pixel in each image is plotted as a function of wavelength, allowing production of a re\\ufb02ectance spectrum of the ink at any given wavelength in order to detect subtle spectral di\\ufb00erences between chemically similar inks. The VSC 6000\\/HS, incorporates both digital technology and hyperspectral imaging capabilities. A preliminary study of a variety of blue, red and black gel inks on white o\\ufb03ce paper analysed using the VSC 6000\\/HS in HSI mode is presented in this poster. The potential of the technique for enhanced discrimination against other traditional methods of examination is highlighted, and together with its non-\\u00addestructive nature and minimal sampling requirements, HSI is shown to take \\ufb01ltered light examination of writing inks into the 21st Century.\"},{\"title\":\"The discrimination of black gel inks by FTIR-ATR and the application of a statistical methodology to achieve objective classification\",\"url\":\"\",\"displayDate\":\"2012-08-20\",\"description\":\"Recent developments in the use of an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) sampling interface incorporated into portable bench-\\u00adtop FTIR spectrometer systems have revolutionised sample analysis providing a simple, rapid, non-\\u00addestructive and cost effective analytical approach for a variety of forensic samples, including ink on paper. A notorious difficulty faced by ink analysts is the discrimination of black gel inks, which because of wide spread use of amorphous carbon black pigment to provide colour, provide limited opportunity for distinguishing different brands. However, in addition to colorants, gel inks also contain other additives such as resins, lubricants and pseudoplasticizers, used to produce the desired properties of a smooth flowing gel ink. These additional constituents provide a rare potential opportunity by which different brands of black gel ink on paper can be discriminated if detectable by FTIR-\\u00ad\\u2010ATR. In this study, 29 black gel inks were analysed using an A2 Technologies ML bench-\\u00adtop FTIR-\\u00ad\\u2010ATR spectrometer system. Visual pattern recognition was used initially to classify the inks into groups based on the presence or absence of peak absorbencies. For the first time, a multivariate statistical methodology based on the clustering techniques of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the form of a Self-\\u00adOrganising Feature Map (SOFM) was also applied to provide an objective means of discrimination. The work presented here discusses some of the findings in relation to this investigation and the development of the statistical methodology.\"},{\"title\":\"Comparison of two Raman Spectrometer systems for the analysis of blue and red gel pen inks using 785nm excitation wavelength\",\"url\":\"\",\"displayDate\":\"2012-08-20\",\"description\":\"Two di\\ufb00erent Raman Spectrometer systems equipped with a 785nm excitation wavelength were used to analyse 31 blue and 26 red gel inks, representing a variety of di\\ufb00erent brand\\/model combinations available on the worldwide market.

The technique can be performed in situ and involves directing a laser of specific excitation wavelength onto an ink sample in order to detect scattered light at longer wavelength to generate a Raman spectrum characteristic of its molecular structure, thus providing a molecular fingerprint for comparison. Different spectra of the same ink sample can be produced by using different excitation wavelengths providing additional discriminating ability. A selection of 31 blue gel ink pens, representing a variety of different brand\\/model combinations available on the worldwide market were analysed using four different excitation wavelengths (514nm, 685nm, 785nm and 830nm). Resulting spectra were grouped according to visual pattern recognition in the first instance, before the application of a multivariate statistical methodology. Well known clustering methods in the form of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were explored, together with a novel approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the form of Self-Organising Feature Maps (SOFM) to objectively discriminate between different brand\\/model combinations.

Then, the application of a multivariate statistical approach in the form of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used in an attempt to discriminate between different brand\\/model combinations. The data presented here discusses some of the findings from this investigation and makes some recommendations as to the use of Raman Spectroscopy in gel ink analysis.\"},{\"title\":\"A population study of polyurethane foam fragments recovered from the surface of 100 outer-garments\",\"url\":\"\",\"displayDate\":\"2010-09\",\"description\":\"One hundred outer garments were examined for microscopic fragments of polyurethane foam. Low power stereomicroscopy was used to classify fragments into 18 groups according to macroscopic colour. Amber, pale yellow and black were the most frequently encountered whilst navy, pale blue, bright pink, beige, brown, pale green, peach and white were the least frequently encountered. High power comparison\\/fluorescence microscopy was used to discriminate 166 sub populations within 16 colour groupings. The majority (95.2%) of populations consisted of 3 fragments or less. This study demonstrates the background population of foam fragments on an outer garment consists of low numbers representing various colours. Therefore, finding a large population of microscopically indistinguishable fragments within a casework situation has the potential to be considered highly significant evidentially.\"},{\"title\":\"A comparison of two Raman Spectrometer systems for the analysis of gel pen ink writings on white office paper using 785nm excitation wavelength\",\"url\":\"\",\"displayDate\":\"2010-06-09\",\"description\":\"Over the past 15 years, the gel pen has become an increasingly popular choice of writing instrument around the globe, primarily due to its relatively low cost, long writing life and environmentally friendly ink composition. The gel pen utilises water based ink composed of either pigments or dyestuffs, giving a wide selection of colours. With this increased popularity, comes a need within the forensic community to find a suitable analytical approach by which to identify and classify different brands and\\/or models of gel ink pen. Raman Spectroscopy has been shown to provide a good ability to discriminate between different pigment based gel inks. The technique can be performed in situ and involves directing a laser of specific excitation wavelength onto an ink sample in order to detect scattered light at longer wavelength to generate a Raman spectrum characteristic of its molecular structure, thus providing a molecular fingerprint for comparison.

To tackle the problem of Ecstasy traffic, law enforcement agencies need intelligence to identify the distribution networks which could lead them to the drug\\u2019s origin.\\n\\nIn recent years, organic impurity profiling, based on the detection by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry of minor impurities present within the final product has provided some assistance in linking seizures of Ecstasy of common origin and suggesting the possible synthetic routes by which the drug was made. However, the technique does not provide conclusive evidence that two seizures originated from the same production batch or even the same laboratory, since the impurities are an extrinsic parameter of the drug molecule, and as such profiles can alter from synthetic batch to synthetic batch.\\n\\nA promising emerging technique in the field of drug analysis is that of Stable Isotope Profiling by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. The starting materials used and the reaction conditions employed throughout the synthesis of the active compound gives the final product an isotopic signature that can be exploited to link seizures of common origin. Since stable isotopes are an intrinsic parameter of the drug molecule they hold the potential to provide forensic evidence of great significance. \\n\\nFor both impurity profiling and stable isotope profiling, suitable extraction methods are required to separate the impurities and the active compound from the tablet matrix. This work specifically presents a comparison of impurity profiles of the same sample of MDMA extracted from simulated tablets by two different methods, one designed solely for impurity profiling, the other designed for dual impurity and stable isotope profiling.\"}]",
